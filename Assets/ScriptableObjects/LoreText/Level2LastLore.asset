  loreText: "To Heather Gi\r\n\r\nFrom Peter Badins\r\n\r\nHeather, what is happening
    in the facility right now?! There are noises coming down the hall that sound
    of shredding metal, animal calls, and screaming. The lab guards are having us
    holed up in our stations and telling us to keep working, but I am afraid for
    my life that something is going down. Even the rabbits here are panicking in
    their cages, about to tear the hinges off their cages. I\u2019m bolting for the
    containment lock first chance I get. Not staying here, and I am warning you to
    do the same since you are closer to the lock. Keep it open for me if you can.\r\n\r\nPeter"
