  loreText: '** CONDITION REPORT OF F-0-HCS **

    

    Subject F-0-HCS has gained
    1012% in mass and has become extremely hostile to all other individuals. While
    it could regenerate mass caused by the injection testing, it has yet to recover
    its eyes it lost prior to the tests. MEI has yet to produce organ regenerative
    properties yet which is still good for subject termination, but to minimize damage
    to the body for later dissection higher-ups called for termination through starvation.
    NO personnel are to enter the containment room to prevent feeding F-0-HCS any
    further. If you are found inside the containment room, you are advised to stay
    quiet and leave the room as it will charge headfirst at the hint of sound.'
