    understand you are a great man and mind within the academic field, but it was
    brought to my attention in a recent report I\u2019ve received from my assistant
    that you have placed in plan a hybrid-creation program. There were already some
    questionable issues regarding your \u2018improved\u2019 MEI-27 serum creation
    method, but to initiate this new project really makes me question what grounds
    you think you had the authority to do this. I was lucky that Ms. Gi found this
    so early so I may have the pleasure to remind you to not play God. I read what
    you proposed. As a doctor on similar status, I suggest you back down from this
    before I get the higher-ups involved.\r\n\r\nEmily Lanes, \r\nP.H.D. Senior Process
    Development Chemist\r\nGeneCorp Chemical R&D Departmen"
