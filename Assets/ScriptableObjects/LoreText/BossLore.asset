  loreText: "** R-488-HIT REPORT **\r\n\r\n    Subject R-488-HIT is currently our
    most successful experiment resulting from the Human Intelligence Testing program.
    Dr. Heisenvofth\u2019s judgement to inject human brain cells in the embryo before
    fetal development has proved to provide greater results than when done in the
    stages after birth. R-488-HIT has a head slightly larger than its body but is
    not hindered physically and has a larger brain as well. Subject is able to solve
    puzzles and mazes as well as use objects though it is advised not to let the
    subject out unsupervised. Vitals and dietary habits are normal. Only oddity is
    that the subject is constantly staring at the door when tests were not conducted.
    Researchers were unable to determine why."
